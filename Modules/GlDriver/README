GlDriver Clean Module
GlDriver is a Clean Module that implements Clean::Driver for the OpenGL library. It tries to be a full cross-platform
modules, so specific platforms files are separated in different directories to clarify sources. Generic sources can 
be found under 'All'. 

GlDriver is implemented as a normal Clean::Driver object. When initializing the GL driver, a Window is created (but hidden
from the user) to ensure GL context creation. First RenderWindow requested by the user will always be already created by the
driver to hold the main GL context. The window is resized to expected size. Some implementation may vary. OpenGL is designed
to create one GL context by window. As the Driver only holds one PixelFormat for all created windows, a GL context can be 
created for each Window but shared with the previous one. As the pixel format is the same, all objects created for one context
should be available for other contexts. 

[OSX NOTES] 
First context is created with NSOpenGLContext. It does not need to be attached to a window/view. When requesting the first RenderWindow
this context is attached to it. When requesting other windows, a new NSOpenGLContext is created shared with the first one.
